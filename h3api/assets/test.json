At the very heart of the city, this island attracts by its architecture, beautiful doors and façades, its narrow cobblestoned streets and its many little shops. Stroll along the tree-lined quays and sit down for a moment to watch the barges go…The show is even more fascinating at night with the lights of the boats reflecting and dancing on the facades. The quintessential romantic! Cafes on the island have superb views of Notre-Dame and Ile de la Cité. All shopping necessities are present on Ile Saint Louis: a pharmacy, a post office, a newsagent, bakeries and pastry cooks, wine and cheese shops, grocery stores and other fine shops.",

The area, especially the part closest to the port, was also informally known as Barri Xinès or Barrio Chino, meaning \"Chinatown\". El Raval is one of the two historical neighborhoods that border La Rambla, the other being the Barri Gòtic, and contains some 50,000 people. An area historically infamous for its nightlife and cabarets, as well as prostitution and crime, El Raval has changed significantly in recent years and due to its central location has become a minor attraction of Barcelona. The northern border of the neighborhood is marked by Plaça Catalunya and Plaça Universitat, and the street which connects them, Carrer de Pelai. It ends in the east with La Rambla, and in the west and south, the neighborhood is delimited by Ronda Sant Antoni, Ronda Sant Pau and Avinguda del Paral·lel. There are a few historical monuments such as the Monastery of Sant Pau del Camp, as well as newer additions such as the Ramb",

I also love music, literature, cinema, and scientific fields such as biology, zoology and botany. I love gardening, and when travelling I visit botanical gardens as well as art museums. I think my house is a reflection of my own interests and tastes, and I hope you will enjoy it and care for it as I do. I’m happy to have the possibility of renting my flat from time to time. For me it’s a great responsibility to receive travellers from all over the world, because I want them to feel comfortable and to offer them a clean, tidy, warm and practical space where they can feel at home. As I’m giving you the keys to my own house, I expect maximum care to be taken by my guests and a most respectful attitude toward the neighbours, avoiding any loud music or noises (especially at night, but also in daylight hours) that could disturb their peace.",

We have two children, a 7 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We have been living in Amsterdam for 20 years and love the city! We enjoy the relaxed vibe and the fact that the city is so compact: One can walk or bike anywhere. We are first time airbnb renters, but have done several home exchanges over the last years, all very successful. We are looking forward to host you in our lovely house!",
